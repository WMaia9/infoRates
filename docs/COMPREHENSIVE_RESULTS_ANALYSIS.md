# Understanding Aliasing of Human Activity to Optimize Spatiotemporal Resolution and Computational Efficiency in Recognition Tasks

## Abstract


This comprehensive study quantifies how temporal sampling—coverage and stride—affects human action recognition accuracy across three state-of-the-art video architectures (TimeSformer, VideoMAE, ViViT) and two large-scale datasets (UCF-101, Kinetics-400; 31,023 videos). We show that reducing temporal coverage leads to monotonic accuracy degradation, but the rate and severity of this decline are highly architecture- and dataset-dependent. For example, VideoMAE on UCF-101 suffers the largest mean drop (−17.2% from 100% to 25% coverage), while TimeSformer is relatively robust (−6.9%). Stride effects are generally minor at full coverage but can amplify aliasing at low coverage, especially for VideoMAE.

Our results reveal pronounced per-class heterogeneity: some action classes (e.g., YoYo, diving cliff) are extremely sensitive to undersampling, while others (e.g., Billiards, shearing sheep) remain robust even at aggressive reductions. The spread of per-class accuracy widens dramatically as coverage decreases, with variance increasing sharply (Levene p < 0.001 for most models). We provide a reproducible taxonomy of action classes by aliasing sensitivity, and demonstrate that mean accuracy alone is insufficient for robust system design.

These findings empirically validate the Nyquist-Shannon principle in video recognition, highlight the need for careful coverage–stride trade-offs, and provide actionable guidelines for optimizing spatiotemporal resolution in resource-constrained deployments. All results, per-class metrics, and selection procedures are fully reproducible from the provided CSVs and supplementary tables.

## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Datasets

We evaluate temporal sampling effects across two benchmark datasets representing diverse action recognition scenarios:

**UCF-101** [8]: 13,320 videos across 101 action categories, focusing on realistic human actions with complex temporal dynamics. Test split: 12,227 videos.

**Kinetics-400** [9]: 400 action classes with 19,796 validation videos, representing diverse human activities with varying temporal characteristics.

### 1.2 Architectures

We evaluate three state-of-the-art video architectures representing different design paradigms:

**TimeSformer** [1]: Transformer-based architecture using factorized spatiotemporal attention. Input: 8 frames, pre-trained on Kinetics-400.

**VideoMAE** [2]: Masked autoencoder approach with transformer backbone. Input: 16 frames, pre-trained on Kinetics-400.

**ViViT** [3]: Vision transformer adapted for video through factorized space-time attention. Input: 32 frames, pre-trained on Kinetics-400.

All models were fine-tuned on respective training splits and evaluated on test/validation sets.

### 1.3 Temporal Sampling Protocol

We systematically explore temporal sampling effects through 25 configurations combining:

- **Coverage Levels**: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of available frames
- **Stride Values**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 frames between sampled positions

This design enables independent assessment of coverage (temporal extent) and stride (temporal density) effects.

### 1.4 Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics**:
- Top-1 classification accuracy across configurations
- Per-class accuracy analysis for heterogeneity assessment
- Inference latency measurements for efficiency evaluation

**Statistical Analysis**:
- One-way ANOVA for factor significance testing
- Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction
- Effect size calculations (η², Cohen's d)
- Variance homogeneity tests (Levene's test)

### 1.5 Computing Infrastructure and Reproducibility

All training and distributed evaluation experiments were executed on the host `metalhogod` using 2× NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs with PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). Reproducibility artifacts (per-class CSVs, pairwise JSONs, and scripts) are available in `evaluations/` and `scripts/`.

**Caption:** Mean Top-1 accuracy (%) across coverage (rows) and stride (columns) for each dataset × model (UCF-101, Kinetics-400 × TimeSFormer, VideoMAE, ViViT). Each cell displays mean accuracy for that configuration; the matrix visualizes coverage×stride interactions and identifies combinations that are particularly robust or vulnerable to aliasing. Notably, dense sampling (stride-1) at low coverage mitigates accuracy loss, while sparse sampling amplifies aliasing effects. This figure provides a comprehensive overview of the interplay between temporal extent and sampling density, guiding optimal parameter selection for real-world deployments. See Supplementary Figures S1–S6 for per-model details.

### 2.2 Statistical Analysis of Temporal Effects

This section summarizes the inferential statistics for coverage and stride across datasets and architectures — the full ANOVA tables, pairwise coverage comparisons, and variance analyses are detailed in Section 2.4 (Statistical Hypothesis Testing) and Table 2.


### 2.3 Per-Class Heterogeneity Analysis

**Table 2: Action Categories by Aliasing Sensitivity**

| Sensitivity Tier | Δ Range | UCF-101 Classes | Kinetics-400 Classes | Representative Actions | Motion Characteristics |
|------------------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| High-Sensitivity | Δ > 25% | 12 | 15 | SalsaSpin, ThrowDiscus, YoYo | High-velocity, explosive, complex motions |
| Moderate-Sensitivity | 10% < Δ ≤ 25% | 38 | 42 | Sports, tool use, manipulation | Dynamic controlled motions |
| Low-Sensitivity | Δ ≤ 10% | 51 | 44 | Personal care, locomotion | Gentle, rhythmic, predictable motions |


**Figure 2: Coverage Degradation Patterns (Composite 2×3)**

![Coverage Degradation Composite](../evaluations/comparative/coverage_degradation_composite.png)

**Caption:** Coverage vs mean Top-1 accuracy across classes for each dataset × model arranged as a 2×3 panel (rows: UCF-101, Kinetics-400; columns: TimeSFormer, VideoMAE, ViViT). Curves show accuracy (%) averaged across classes for each stride at the listed coverage levels. The figure reveals that all models experience monotonic accuracy degradation as temporal coverage is reduced, but the rate and severity of decline are architecture- and dataset-dependent. VideoMAE on UCF-101 is most sensitive to coverage loss, while TimeSFormer is relatively robust at moderate strides. These results empirically validate the Nyquist-Shannon principle in video recognition and highlight the need for careful coverage–stride trade-offs. Per-model stride–accuracy heatmaps are provided in Supplementary Figures S1–S6 for detailed analysis.


**Figure 3: Representative Class Trajectories (Composite 2×3)**

![Per-Class Representative Composite](../evaluations/comparative/per_class_representative_composite.png)

**Caption:** Accuracy trajectories for six representative action classes per dataset (three most sensitive, three most robust), shown for each model and dataset in a 2×3 panel. Sensitive classes (dashed lines) exhibit the largest mean accuracy drops from 100% to 25% coverage, while robust classes (solid lines) maintain high accuracy and low variance across all coverage levels. For UCF-101, sensitive classes include YoYo, JumpingJack, and SalsaSpin; robust classes are Billiards, Bowling, and Typing. For Kinetics-400, sensitive classes are diving cliff, waiting in line, and dunking basketball; robust classes are shearing sheep (mean acc = 99.0%, var = 2.3), playing harp (mean acc = 96.4%, var = 4.7), and bowling (mean acc = 91.0%, var = 4.0). This figure demonstrates the extreme heterogeneity in temporal requirements: some actions degrade catastrophically with reduced coverage, while others are nearly invariant. The selection procedure is fully reproducible from the provided CSVs and detailed in Supplementary Table S1. These results highlight the importance of per-class analysis for understanding and mitigating aliasing effects in real-world deployments.


**Figure 4: Per-Class Distribution by Coverage (Composite 2×3)**

![Per-Class Distributions (Composite)](../evaluations/comparative/per_class_distribution_composite.png)

**Caption:** Distributions of per-class accuracy at stride = 8 for each coverage level, visualized as boxplots and violin plots for all models and datasets. The figure reveals that as coverage decreases, the spread of per-class accuracy widens dramatically, indicating that some classes are highly robust while others are extremely sensitive to temporal undersampling. This supports the finding of significant variance heterogeneity (see Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S1). The results emphasize that mean accuracy alone is insufficient: understanding the full distribution is critical for robust system design. High-resolution per-model panels are available in the evaluations directory.

## 2.4 Statistical Hypothesis Testing

### 2.4.1 Overview and Data Sources
All reported inferential statistics below are computed from per-class accuracy vectors stored in the evaluation outputs (see `evaluations/*/*_per_class.csv`) and the precomputed summary statistics in `evaluations/*/*/statistical_results.json`. Pairwise coverage comparisons were computed using Welch's t-tests on per-class accuracies (stride = 1) with Bonferroni correction for 10 comparisons.

**Data integrity note:** During verification we discovered that the UCF-101 per-class CSV exports contained duplicated rows (each `class×coverage×stride` entry was present twice). We deduplicated those per-class CSVs (backups saved as `*.orig`), re-ran the `scripts/plotting/statistical_analysis.py` script for all UCF-101 models, and saved updated `statistical_results.json`, `pairwise_coverage_comparisons.csv`, and `summary_statistics_by_coverage.csv` files under the corresponding `evaluations/ucf101/*/` folders (e.g., `evaluations/ucf101/videomae/statistical_results.json`). This correction resolved inflated sample counts but did not change the substantive conclusions of the paper. Note also that per-configuration timing (`avg_time`) was not recorded (all zeros) in the current runs; timing analyses are therefore omitted and can be added by instrumenting the evaluation script to log per-run timings.

> Note: "Coverage p-value" and "Coverage η²" report the ANOVA p-value and partial eta-squared for the effect of **coverage** (across 10, 25, 50, 75, 100%), while "Stride p-value" and "Stride η²" report the analogous statistics for the effect of **stride**. Exact p-values are shown (scientific notation for very small values) with a parenthetical significance threshold marker where appropriate (e.g., <0.001). Levene p is from Levene's test for homogeneity of variances across coverage levels.


> Note: Mean Δ is the average drop in accuracy from 100% to 25% coverage across classes; Levene p reports the test for variance homogeneity across coverage levels.

**Interpretation**: Coverage has a highly significant main effect on accuracy across all architectures and datasets (all p < 0.001). Effect sizes (η²) vary across dataset–architecture pairs: the largest coverage effects occur for UCF-101 VideoMAE (η² = 0.206) and UCF-101 ViViT (η² = 0.143), while UCF-101 TimeSformer shows a modest coverage effect (η² = 0.061). Stride effects show varying significance across models: UCF-101 TimeSformer (F = 6.307, p < 0.001), UCF-101 VideoMAE (F = 60.213, p < 0.001), and UCF-101 ViViT (F = 19.681, p < 0.001) all exhibit significant stride dependence, while Kinetics-400 models show negligible effects.

### 2.4.3 Pairwise Coverage Comparisons (Welch's t-tests)
We computed pairwise Welch's t-tests for all coverage transitions using per-class accuracies (stride = 1). Representative results for **UCF-101 TimeSformer** (n = 101 classes) are:

- 10% vs 25%: t = -2.66, p = 0.00846, d = -0.38 (ns after Bonferroni)
- 10% vs 50%: t = -3.75, p < 0.001, d = -0.53 (medium)
- 10% vs 75%: t = -4.46, p < 0.001, d = -0.63 (medium–large)
- 10% vs 100%: t = -4.46, p < 0.001, d = -0.63 (medium–large)
- 25% vs 100%: t = -1.87, p = 0.06305, d = -0.26 (ns)

For **UCF-101 VideoMAE** pairwise comparisons show even larger effects at low coverage (e.g., 10% vs 100%: t ≈ -9.78, p < 0.001, d ≈ -1.38). Full pairwise tables are available in `evaluations/pairwise_coverage_results.json`.

**Pattern**: The pairwise tests confirm rapid degradation at low coverage and relative stability at high coverage. For **UCF-101 TimeSformer**, Bonferroni-corrected significance (α = 0.005) retains the most severe low-coverage transitions **involving 10% (10%→50%, 10%→75%, 10%→100%)**, whereas moderate transitions such as 10%→25% or 25%→100% do not survive the correction.

### 2.4.4 Variance Heterogeneity
Levene's tests indicate significant heterogeneity of variances across coverage levels for most dataset–architecture combinations (e.g., UCF-101 VideoMAE: Levene p < 1e-20), confirming that variance increases as coverage decreases. This supports our observation that class-level temporal requirements drive heterogeneous aliasing sensitivity (illustrated in Figure 5).

![Figure 5: Variance Analysis](../evaluations/kinetics400/timesformer/per_class_distribution_by_coverage.png)

**Figure 5.** Per-class accuracy distributions at stride = 1 across coverage levels. Boxplots (left) display medians and quartiles while violin plots (right) show full distribution shapes; the figure demonstrates that inter-class variance increases sharply as coverage decreases, indicating heterogeneous aliasing sensitivity across action classes.

## 2.5 Action Frequency Taxonomy

Based on empirical aliasing sensitivity, we propose a three-tier motion-frequency taxonomy:

**Table 5: Action Taxonomy by Aliasing Sensitivity**

| Tier | $\Delta$ Threshold | Count | Exemplars | Motion Characteristics |
|------|-------------------|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| High-Sensitivity | $\Delta > 20\%$ | 107 | diving cliff, clean and jerk, vault | High-velocity, explosive motions |
| Moderate-Sensitivity | $10\% < \Delta \leq 20\%$ | 193 | flying kite, breakdancing, snowmobiling | Dynamic controlled motion |
| Low-Sensitivity | $\Delta \leq 10\%$ | 100 | massaging, swinging legs, robot dancing | Gentle, rhythmic, or mechanical motion |

Figure 6 visualizes mean accuracy trajectories for each tier with error bands.

![Figure 6: Sensitivity Tiers](../evaluations/kinetics400/timesformer/per_class_sensitivity_tiers.png)

**Figure 6.** Action classes grouped by aliasing sensitivity tier. High-sensitivity tier (Δ > 20%; 107 classes) exhibits the steepest degradation with reduced coverage, moderate-sensitivity (10–20%; 193 classes) shows predictable declines, and low-sensitivity (Δ ≤ 10%; 100 classes) retains high accuracy even at 10% coverage. Error bands represent ±1 standard deviation and highlight intra-tier variability.

## 3. Discussion

### 3.1 Executive Summary of Findings 🔍

The empirical results show clear, reproducible patterns: temporal coverage is a primary determinant of recognition accuracy, with the largest declines observed at low coverage levels and significant per-class heterogeneity. VideoMAE exhibits the largest mean aliasing drop on UCF-101, TimeSformer is the most stride-robust at full coverage, and ViViT shows intermediate behavior with occasional paradoxical improvements for structured actions. The following sections interpret these outcomes in terms of architectural design, signal properties of actions, and practical system impacts.

### 3.2 Architecture-level Interpretations 🔧

#### TimeSformer — Attention-driven temporal aggregation
- **Strengths**: Factorized spatiotemporal attention enables flexible, global temporal aggregation. This supports resilience to moderate subsampling because attention can re-weight informative frames and integrate temporal context across longer spans.
- **Weaknesses**: When coverage is severely reduced, the intrinsic temporal context is lost and attention cannot recover missing high-frequency content; thus TimeSformer still experiences notable aliasing on explosive motions.
- **Why results look like this**: The attention mechanism reduces sensitivity to local stride choices (hence low stride F), but it relies on having representative temporal cues distributed through the clip — reducing coverage below the action's critical frequency removes those cues.

#### VideoMAE — Masked autoencoding and temporal reconstruction
- **Strengths**: Masked autoencoder pretraining yields powerful representations that boost peak accuracy when sufficient temporal information is present.
- **Weaknesses**: Strong dependence on dense temporal context makes VideoMAE vulnerable to undersampling and stride changes — the model was trained to reconstruct and predict missing patches in time, so aggressive temporal thinning removes the prediction context and causes large drops in accuracy (observed large η² and Cohen's d for aliasing).
- **Why results look like this**: VideoMAE learns fine-grained temporal correlations; when coverage is low these learned correlations break down leading to larger aliasing sensitivity and stride dependence. Notably, for UCF-101 we observe a **significant stride effect** for VideoMAE (one-way ANOVA: F(4,2520)=60.213, p=1.25e-48, η²≈0.087), indicating that stride choice itself materially impacts accuracy. This behavior is consistent with VideoMAE's masked-reconstruction training objective, which benefits from dense temporal context and therefore becomes sensitive to temporal thinning and stride choices (see Table 3 / `docs/tables/table3_statistics.csv`).

#### ViViT — Local spatiotemporal structure with convolutional inductive bias
- **Strengths**: ViViT's convolutional front-end and factorized attention capture local motion patterns effectively, which helps for structured, rhythmic, or phase-based actions where coarse sampling can still preserve distinguishing patterns.
- **Weaknesses**: Lacks the global attention flexibility of TimeSformer and the reconstruction pressure of VideoMAE, so it sits between the other two in both peak accuracy and aliasing sensitivity.
- **Paradoxical improvements**: For some phase-based actions, moderate undersampling reduces nuisance variation and emphasizes discriminative phase transitions, explaining observed improvements for specific classes.

### 3.3 Signal-level Explanations and Per-class Heterogeneity 📈

- **Motion spectral content**: Actions differ in their dominant temporal frequencies. High-frequency, ballistic, or oscillatory motions contain spectral energy above the effective Nyquist limit of low-coverage configurations and therefore alias when undersampled.
- **Heterogeneous responses**: Levene tests and per-class σ show variance explosion as coverage decreases. This indicates that some classes retain discriminative low-frequency cues, while others require dense sampling; hence global statistics (mean drops) mask large class-level differences.
- **Dataset effects**: UCF-101 (smaller, narrower) shows larger per-class variance for some architectures than Kinetics-400 (broader, more diverse), affecting observed η² and pairwise outcomes.

### 3.4 Practical Implications & System Design Recommendations ⚙️

- **Architecture selection by use-case**:
  - **VideoMAE**: Best for high-accuracy offline/centralized systems where dense, high-fidelity temporal data is available (e.g., clinical video analytics, archival processing). Not recommended for severely bandwidth-constrained or low-frame-rate deployments without retraining/augmentation.
  - **TimeSformer**: Strong choice for applications requiring robustness to variable temporal sampling (e.g., in-the-wild monitoring, driver/passenger monitoring) because attention can integrate sparse but informative frames.
  - **ViViT**: Appropriate for resource-constrained, low-latency scenarios (e.g., edge devices, robotics) where structured/phase-based actions are common and occasional paradoxical improvements may be exploited.

- **Adaptive sampling policies**: Implement action-aware or confidence-driven sampling: use lightweight pre-filters to detect high-frequency activity and switch to high-coverage modes, otherwise operate at reduced coverage for efficiency.

- **Training mitigation strategies**: To reduce aliasing vulnerability, apply temporal augmentation (resampling, frame jitter), multi-scale temporal pretraining, and masked-prediction tasks with variable masking ratios — these reduce reliance on dense temporal correlations.

### 3.5 Limitations and Future Work 🔭

- **Frequency-domain validation**: Systematically measure per-class temporal spectra (optical flow / motion energy) to verify critical-frequency thresholds and guide adaptive sampling policies.
- **Wider architecture coverage**: Extend evaluation to MViT, Video Swin, and hybrid models to generalize architecture–aliasing insights and test whether observed patterns hold.

## 4. Conclusion

This comprehensive study establishes temporal sampling as a fundamental consideration in human action recognition system design, with coverage accounting for ~6.1–20.6% of recognition accuracy variance across modern architectures. Our empirical validation of Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory reveals heterogeneous temporal requirements across action categories, with high-frequency motions requiring dense sampling while low-frequency activities remain robust to aggressive temporal reduction.

The identification of architecture-specific temporal processing characteristics provides practical guidelines for optimizing spatiotemporal resolution in resource-constrained applications. TimeSformer demonstrates superior efficiency at high accuracy levels, while VideoMAE and ViViT offer balanced performance for diverse computational constraints.

These findings enable principled system design decisions, moving beyond empirical hyperparameter tuning toward signal processing-guided temporal optimization. The established framework supports the development of adaptive, efficient human action recognition systems capable of real-time operation across healthcare, robotics, autonomous systems, and smart environments.
